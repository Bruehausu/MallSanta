"I had a mall Santa try to feel me up once. I wasn't some little kid or anything, though. I was like sixteen and goofing off with some friends and we were all sitting on his lap taking pictures. In retrospect, a bad decision anyway. But that was when mall Santa's and Easter Bunnies became creepy for me. \n\nA Christmas Story didn't help either.",
"My dad's family lives in Canada, so every Christmas we would fly up there to visit everyone. Since my rich uncle with all the money planned everything, we always went the week before Christmas, and flew back Christmas Eve so he could go on his traditional Christmas Cruise with his wife (yeah, I know it sounds douchey, but he's a chill guy. Plus the airports are much more relaxed on Christmas Eve). Anyway, so this time my brother is about 6 and I'm about to turn 8. Perfect age for traveling nightmares, right? Well, god decides to shit out snow all over the Toronto airport, and we spend 8 hours on Christmas Eve trapped inside the airport. My brother and I are being horribly bratty because we're hungry and want to open presents and run around. Finally, after the 8 hour delay, we get on our plane and end up back landing around 1am. Now, it's at this point that my mother realizes she has no food at home for us to eat. She's got two starving, up-too-late brats and NO FOOD. It's 1am. The only place open is Waffle House. So we had our Christmas dinner (because it was about 3am Dec 25 by the time we get home) at a fucking Waffle House. The only other people in there?  A bunch of drunk mall Santas who told my brother and I that we were being lied to and this whole Santa thing was a load of bullshit.\n\nTL;DR: had xmas dinner at a waffle house full of drunk santas who told my baby brother and I the truth about Santa",
"And here, with my mouth unhinged a nanosecond before I could summon a desperate plea for help, is the moment I stopped believing in God.\n\nYou can laugh at the absurdity of that statement, but to a seven year old boy just happy to be at the mall in his brown saddle vamp square toe boots, getting molested by Santa Claus while trying to avoid looking into his dead, cracked out eyes is a little traumatic.\n\nAt this point in my life I knew of no evil greater than my friend Jake stealing my favorite Lion King collectible plastic cup, of which I had secured five of the eight advertised. I was a good kid, complacent to be alive and shuffled from home, to soccer practice, to school, to Jake\u2019s house. Going to the mall on a Saturday afternoon was not alarming, and the promise of actually meeting Santa for me was like promising a little girl a unicorn. Honestly, though, if someone promised me a unicorn today I would be all over that, as long as it was a bad-ass unicorn that impaled the people who tried to stop us from doing whatever it is that unicorn-human duos\u2026do.  \n\nAnyway. The real trouble began when I was close enough to \u201cSanta\u2019s Workshop\u201d to notice that every child trudging through the exit line wore the face of someone who had just seen pure evil. Their eyes were bleary; their gaze focused somewhere far-off...a place I hoped never to be. Something was wrong. But, being a seven year old, I had shinier things to worry about.\n\nWithout warning it was my turn, and from nowhere Esteban, Santa\u2019s flaming gay Elf, had me by the arm en route to Santa\u2019s throne of tears. No, no, no\u2026this wasn\u2019t Santa at all. This was obviously a ruse. Did they think I wouldn\u2019t be able to tell that his beard is fake? And why was that Elf named Esteban? He wasn\u2019t even Hispanic. The world began to spin around me as I tried to make sense of it all. The musty smelling, faded backdrop, the neckbearded camera operator. Then, a brilliant flash from all directions. Did he just touch my penis? No seriously, I think he just touched my penis. Someone definitely did. Santa grumbles and Esteban has me again \u2013 up, quickly shuffling in some direction. By now I am sobbing for my mother \u2013 that wench! How could she abandon me with a man who smelled like Hennessey and regret? I also smelled human feces, but I\u2019m not prepared to blame him entirely for that. Like I said, it was a blur.\n\nThe rest of the day is gone from my memory, as is much of my early childhood.\n\nI open my eyes, a single tear running down my cheek as I clench the unearthed photo tight through white knuckles.\n\nI thought it was lost forever. But here, thirty-one  years later, those same terrified eyes retrace the contours of every detail from that horrible moment. They say we need to keep \u201cChrist in Christmas\u201d and I tend to agree, because there\u2019s no way anyone has a picture of Jesus molesting them when they were seven.\n\nThat day was the beginning of a downward spiral for me. I was nearly expelled from my elementary school after I bit a school nurse on her arm-flab. You know, the jiggly part of the upper-arm that every school nurse and lunch lady has? Yeah I bit that, and to this day I don\u2019t know why. I don\u2019t know why I did a lot of things.\n\nI quickly learned that the world is full of lies, and everybody, including myself is in perpetual lying mode. People are paid to lie to you. Marketers, politicians, pundits, Amy Birchler (you know what you did).  Even teachers, firemen, and friends will lie to you. Santa was just the tip of the iceberg. Also, that particular Santa was found dead near some train tracks by a movie theater by my house six months after this photo was taken. That\u2019s largely irrelevant but there hasn\u2019t been a good time to really tell you, and I was worried I might forget. You may think it\u2019s a trivial detail but I think it\u2019s important for his character to have some resolution. He was survived by his mother Nancy and his Doberman, Lucy.\n\nMy teenage years were rambunctious and fueled by an excess of alcohol and libido. I wanted to fuck everything that moved and several things that didn\u2019t. I trusted nobody but used everybody. I\u2019m thirty-eight years old, now, and starting a new job in exactly forty-four minutes. Mom says it\u2019s a chance to start something new, something without any previous setbacks.\n\nI glance down at the Polaroid. \u201cSeason\u2019s Greetings,\u201d I read the partially out-of-frame banner aloud to myself, shaking my head. A painful smirk. Or was it a grimace?\n\nA faint rushing sound becomes increasingly louder and I remember I am standing in front of my bathroom sink. The faucet is relentlessly vomiting water which dances around the basin violently. I blink. Hesitate.\n\nA flick of the wrist and the bent and wrinkled photograph is no match for the barrage of bonded hydrogen and oxygen molecules. It swells slightly before the image begins to fade away, distorting the magical moment that changed me forever.\n\nI look back up at the man staring at me in the mirror. I adjust my itchy, strap-on beard and velvet suit. I take a deep breath of the body odor of dozens of mall Santas past, a mild stench that envelops me constantly while I\u2019m trapped in the costume.\n\nI remember Oppenheimer\u2019s famous quotation of The Bhagavad Gītā: \u201cNow, I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.\u201d\n\nI narrow my eyes.\n\nNow, I am become Mall Santa, destroyer of Christmas.\n\n\n\n\n**tl;dr: Justin Bieber actually has a nice voice, guys.**",
"I knew a Santa impersonator. He would come into my mall bar after he got off work as a mall santa and have a beer after hours. Real cool guy. His wife was a Mrs. Claus impersonator too.  Here's the thing with mall santas. They are a part of a santa coalition I suppose you could call it. If you want to be a Mall santa you have to adhere by certain rules within this sorta union. You sign a contract saying you will be santa all year long no matter what. If you are in bermuda enjoying a vacation, As long as you have that beard you must wear christmas themed swimming trunks or you must wear red at all times. YOU ARE SANTA no matter what.\n\nIf disney is asking him to say a script or tell him he cant be santa. It goes against all he has worked towards and the shattered dreams of children. Technically if caught he can lose his job.",
"I was a mall Santa for several years during the '90s and saw a few old guys endure the job.  One year, right after my shift, the guy after me was out on the chair and had a kid on his lap and he started spitting and swearing and pushed the kid off, stood up and then collapsed back in the chair. He'd had a stroked.  The following year he came to visit me during my shift and explained that the doctors didn't think he'd last 12 hours.  When he did, they said that he wouldn't survive a week ... but he did.  And kept going. He'd lost a lot of mobility, but at least he didn't have to be Santa again.  ",
"This is true.\n\nWhen I was a young child, I told the Mall Santa I wanted my dad to stop drinking whiskey until he puked and for my mom to stop throwing shit at him when they fought because I was trying to sleep at 3 AM. He kind of stuttered and said, \"I'll... see what I can do, kid. Now, how about a *gift?\"*\n\nMall Santa must have told my aunt, who I was with at the time, because she bought me the gift I asked Mall Santa for on the spot.\n\nIt was glorious. Plus my parents were separated a year later. \n\nThank you, Mall Santa!",
"Mall santa story time? Go!\n\nMy grandfather, tough old boot, WWII veteran, gone to his reward now, was a mall santa in the late 90s. He loved it, and I would often pick him up after working there and we would drink a beer at his place afterwards. One day I drove down to the mall to pick him up, and he wasn't there. I knew he was worried about his heart at the time, and feared the worst when I was told by a security guard he had been taken to hospital. \n\nHe had been mall-Santa-ing it up and had just sat down after his lunch break when a little boy of around six had his turn to sit on Santa's knee. This little boy didn't want to. He **really** didn't wan't to. He expressed his displeasure in the form of kicks. He kicked my grandfather so hard in the balls that they took him to hospital because they were worried he had ruptured something.\n\nHe was actually quite ok, apart from being sore. They were worried mostly because he threw up about five minutes after copping it in the crotch. He ended up living about another 7 years after this. I love breaking out this story around this time of year.\n\ntl;dr: grandfather mall Santa kicked in the nuts to the point of puking by 6-year-old, hospitalised.",
"I wasn't the santa, I was the kid, but this may still be applicable.\n\nSo I was at the mall with my mom and brother and I was probably around six or seven years old.  I went to sit on santa's lap and I reached up to whisper in his ear, right?  So I look up at him, and he turned around and gave me the creepiest smile I had ever seen.  I got so scared that I tried to jump back off of his lap and his beard snagged on my jacket zipper.  Not only was his beard yanked off, but I tripped and fell down the stairs leading up to Santa's chair.  \"Santa\" tried to run and help me up, but I was so scared I tried to crawl away as I cried, and when he grabbed my arm I swept my legs out behind me and down goes santa.  He tried to get back onto his feet, but his pant leg had gone over my boots and it yanked his underpants-less santa sweats down.  \n\nTl;DR: Six year old manages to reduce mall santa clause to naked-from-the-waste-down, beardless creepy guy.",
"I worked as an elf at a mall santa years ago. He was a creepy ex-con polygamist from Kentucky who had a new 17 year old wife and something like 24 kids between 8 women. He had prison tattoos and diamond earrings and would get high on his breaks.\n\n Us girls had to walk butts facing away from him (really unnatural when you are trying to position kids around) because he \"liked our birthing hips\". He once got bitched out by a husband who spotted santa looking down his wife's shirt. He liked \"new moms\" the best because of their breasts and they had to bend down in front of him to place their kids. \n\nHe made a thousand dollars *a day* as santa. He was brought up from Kentucky to Ohio and stayed in a nice hotel for a month with all 800 of his family members. By about early December he would turn into a complete nightmare and we wouldn't even speak to him. \n\nThat job was a clusterfuck.",
"When I used to work late holiday shifts at an American Eagle Outfitters, I was fortunate enough to see the poor miserable bastard stumble out to his car in a drunken rage. Santa kinda fell into the driver's seat sideways, shouted something about children being a waste of his time/life, then proceeded to vomit into a nearby pile of snow. That night, I was kinda warmed inside by the fact that Santa self medicated with hard liquor just like me. ",
"I did some awful things to my little sister.\n\nI grabbed stationery by the mall Santa intended for parents to write return letters from the big man himself, and wrote my seven year old sister a letter about how bad of a child she was and how the puppy she wanted was killed by the elves when they found out she had stolen my candy from a birthday party gift bag. I left it in the mailbox and she cried and cried.\n\nI also convinced her she was hit by a car when she was little and that's why her back is mishapen.",
"My uncle was a mall Santa, and I got to help out as an elf for about 7 years.\n\nWe ran the gamut of funny to touching to screaming-their-heads off. Those always actually pissed my uncle off pretty badly because the parents would yell at the kids for not sitting with what I'd imagine seemed like a creepy stranger (and why are Mommy and Daddy walking away?). One clever trick that most parents were happy with was having the mom or dad sit in Santa's chair and hold the kid, and the elves would distract the kid while Santa sneaked in. Worked like a charm 95% of the time.\n\nWe did have the one six year old girl who up and bolted (seriously, poor girl was having a panic attack), and then there was the one year a mom was getting her 3-month-old twins out of the stroller and one projectile-vomited and missed Santa by about 3 inches. There were definitely several older women who asked my very happily married uncle to do slightly naughty things to them for the camera... in a room full of kids. A few actually were visibly dejected after hearing that there was a Mrs. Claus in the picture.\n\nIt also amused me that my uncle was the plant engineer (basically handyman) at my elementary school, and the kids knew him well and loved him, but never ever recognized him (even though he would call them by name!) because he hid his beard in his vest at school, and then shaved right after Christmas. He also wore different glasses... that he couldn't see for anything in, but dammit, they made him look like Santa!",
"My grandmother was complaining that she didn't have any current pictures of my dad and my uncle, both of whom were roughly college aged at the time. So they went to visit a local mall Santa. As my dad tells it, Santa was off duty and tring to get an elf's phone number, but once they approached him for a photo, he went into character and kept it up through the whole photo shoot. So my grandparents got their current picture of their two adult sons sitting with Santa.\n\nI also have a friend who worked a mall Santa set one year. His Santa had a degree in child psychology, which was fun. He told me about one time when they had a little girl who was kind of afraid of Santa and no line behind her, so they got a ball and played catch with her and gradually included Santa to help her overcome her fears. He also told me that Santa swears like a sailor in his off hours.",
"Child climbed up into my lap, looked up into my eyes with his huge, soulful eyes, and asked timidly, \"Santee, can I have my daddy back for kismis?\" \n\nImmediately choked up. I struggled to maintain composure, looked at the little boy right in his eyes, and said, \"Buddy......I can't do that. You see, he's in rehab now for flying into that drunken, pill-induced rage after he told you for the millionth-and-one time to clean your fucking room cus you're sloven and depraved little slob and won't listen.\" Then, right as the little guy realized that Santa *is* real and *does* see everything, I backhanded him right off my lap and gave him a firm bootstomp in the ass to send him on his way. \n\nOh, and I should mention I'm not a \"Mall Santa\", I just dress up in a red suit and a beard and wait around on mall benches. ",
"Story time!  I'll try to keep it short. \n\nCathy and Bill were this old couple who lived next door to us in a trailer when I was growing up.  They'd gotten together later in life and we didn't know much about them, over the years their stories took weird turns.  They were both creepy and sad, and a little evil too. \n\nThese people used to baby sit me when I was younger.  They preferred my brother and used to tell me really fucked up shit, like \"You are so wicked and evil, one day the devil is going to open the ground and swallow you up!\" They would punish me for fighting with my mom or getting into trouble at home the day before.  I'd be sent to a room and told to sit on the bed and stay there.   Cathy would take my brother out to the park or out for ice cream while I sat alone in the room.  Bill was usually watching TV in the living room.  She'd rub it in my face, telling me \"good kids get ice cream and bad children get naps.\"   She'd tell me that my mom gave her permission to beat me, she'd pull out a big wooden spoon and threaten me for minor things like saying I didn't want to watch Rescue Rangers on TV anymore.  It was all about my brother and what he wanted to do, if I even disagreed for a minute I was treated like dirt.  Eventually it got so bad, I just refused to go over there anymore and my mom allowed me to stay home by myself after school.  \n\nNow for the creepy shit:  She was the definition of a nosy neighbor.  We'd look out our windows and see her looking back at us most of the time, windows open in winter trying to hear what was going on at our house!  Once she told my brother to ask my father to trim the bushes because \"I can't see what's going on over at your place anymore.\"  That's when dad stopped cutting the bushes altogether.  She would hear my dad yell at us over something and call a few minutes later to see what we did.  Cathy told us she had one son from her previous marriage.  He'd been around a bit here and there.  One day, she was crying to my mom on the phone and told her that he'd died in a car accident.  Imagine our surprise several years later when he turned up again to make amends with her.  They'd had a fight and she told everybody he died.  People felt bad for her, they prayed for her, they brought her food and checked on her...and she'd been lying the entire time.  \n\nBill was also a creep.  He was from a town called Marion, where when he was a very young boy, was forced to watch the hanging of a couple of black men.  He told us about it when we were little kids.  He was very racist too, probably because of where he was from.  There was a night I woke up and saw him standing at the edge of the property line, looking straight into my bedroom window which was only about 10 feet away.  I started covering it with blankets, my parents assured me that he was just a senile old man and probably wasn't creeping.  There was another situation where I was laying out in the sun, probably more over on his side of the property line than my own, but our yard was very small and the property owner allowed us to use 5 or so feet of her yard as our own and we had a friendly agreement with her that Cathy and Bill were told to honor.  There was to be none of that \"kids out of my yard\" bullshit.  So I'm laying there listening to music in the sun and I get suddenly kicked very hard in my side.  I sit up and grab my side because it hurt, Bill yells something about me being a slut and walks away.  Edit: Forgot to add that Bill also had children of his own, but always referred to them as \"bitches\" and said he hadn't seen them in years.\n\nOnce he died, Cathy became very lonely.  She started pulling bullshit to get people to come to her house like asking for help she didn't really need.  One time she called 911 because she was out of bacon and couldn't drive to the store in winter.   The town marshal showed up with groceries for her, that's when she told him she'd only needed the bacon because she was craving it, not that she didn't have any food at all.   Eventually these antics got to be too much for everyone and people were called in to determine her mental health situation.  She was taken to a home to be cared for by the state because she had no family who could care for her or even make the decision to put her in a home.  I don't know where her son was at this point, maybe \"dead\" again.  When they were cleaning out her room, they found birth certificates and evidence that she did have other children than her son, children with another man a lifetime ago, children who hated their mother and never wanted to see her again apparently. I heard they found five birth certificates in all. Found out from my mom that Cathy's son had been arrested for child molestation.  He was a mall santa and fondled a little girl while she was on his lap. So...that's why she told everyone he died. \n\n",
"Two years ago I was fresh to the city that I currently work/live in, it was Christmas time and being alone I wanted to at least do my part to make others individual holidays improved as best I could (and try and have some human contact in the process). As such, I volunteered to help run the catering for a Children's Hospital's cancer ward Christmas Dinner. \n\nI am tasked with working alone and documenting all the individuals that enter the event, and take orders for family members that cannot leave their children's hospital rooms. Stuck in the corner but I had a full and fantastic view of the entire event. \n\nThese adults looked like Kosovo refugees, these poor adults were rude, cranky and difficult to manage, please forgive me for even listing complainants about these people. It is fully understood that they are currently living through every parent's worst nightmare. But I assure this tidbit plays into the story, I promise. \nSo the adults gather up the coloring books, toys, yadda yadda,  for their children, the children being patients or siblings/friends of patients. The parents having properly distracted their children begin eating a nice hot meal, generously donated from a local catering firm (thank you). \nAnd then it happens.\nSanta from off in the distance lets out the universal Santa call of joy that we as adults find ubiquitously posted on Christmas Cards.\nHO-HO-HO!\nAll of \u2018em, every damn one of them, from the healthy 10 year olds to the 4 year old in the wheelchair, collectively turn their shell-shocked faces. It's like somebody turned off the hospital and warped them all back to childhood. The excitement and joy, that \"Oh! Oh my gosh! It\u2019s HIM!\" faces, I will never forget. \n\nThose that can jump up and run toward the voice have. Meeting our Hero Santa right as he turns the corner. And by god he looked worse than the sick kids. Limping heavily on a cane, older than the actual Saint Nick he negotiates the corner best he can and then bellows out another HO-HO-HO. \n\nThe kids lose it. \n\nThis ancient old man, made the rounds to every child there, visibly looked pained when kids sat on his lap (damnit it he didn't let a single child know it). Just normal families doing the traditional, normal Santa visit.  I still have a hard time wrapping my brain around how quickly morale turned around for these families. Thank you so very much Santa.\n\nI apologize for the length, I\u2019ll try and deliver a solid TL:DR at the bottom.\n\nLater on after the event had wrapped up the staff asked us if we would help deliver our \u201cto go\u201d orders that I had taken down earlier. I was riding my Santa visit high and wanted to continue helping out. As it turns out the refugees I met earlier had makeshift camps set up around children\u2019s ward. A private-ish corner, two public seating style bench chairs pushed together, a TV to distract them. I handed out food as quietly and humbly as possibly could, mumbling \u201cmerry Christmases and happy Holidays\u201d as I went. \n\nI entered one room, walking head down to the far of the room, avoiding eye contact with the patient bed area. I meekly handed over a lukewarm meal to the shell of a poor Mother. As I turned to go I glanced at the patient, and then came to a dead stop.\nTubes. Thick, black, industrial looking tubes poured into this pink ball. \u201cOh christ, no\u201d I thought \u201cThis is rotten, no child should have to live like this, this poor godforsaken family\u201d I thought like your typical lucky-to-never-have-had-to-endure-this-sort-of-tragedy-person. \nThen I saw her, her little wiggly hand was making a squeezing motion to me. She was saying hello, greeting her Christmas visitor. Certainly she was being more polite than I was. When she realized she had my attention she smiled at me and squeezed/waved harder. \n\nOh-good-deity-person-from-above, she was adorable. And she had no idea that any of this was strange, \u201cNo sweetie two year olds don\u2019t look Neo awakening in the \u201creal world\u201d, well actually pumpkin most kids do live to see five years old.\u201d She was just being a friendly, curious, sweet little baby. \n\nAnd I think of her often, she reminds me to be a good human being to everyone, if you stop to indulge your own pity then you waste a chance to help enhance someone else\u2019s time on this planet.  If a crippled Santa and sick infant can be a part of the upward march of humanity then so can we. \n\nHey thanks for letting me share this, I never know how to bring it up to people because it was an experience I deem important. Please volunteer when you can, it can make a world of difference to strangers who need to be reminded of human comfort. \n\nTL:DR a hospital Santa and a terminally ill infant remind us all to good things, because why not.\n\n",
"When I was preschool, I wanted to be just like my older brothers. They were pretty talented athletes as kids, so they were constantly bringing home trophies and medals. This sparked a deep desire for a trophy of my own in my five year old heart. I wanted one. Badly. As Christmas rolled around, I was doing my best to behave well. After all, Santa checks his list twice. I was so terrified that I would have coal in my stocking that I cried, expressing my fears to my mother - right as I waited in line to sit on the lap of a mall Santa. She reassured me, telling me that \"I was the best kid in the whole wide world.\" So, of course, when my turn to sit on Santa's lap came around, I told him that I was the best kid in the whole wide world, and that I wanted the trophy to prove it. My wonderful mother, bless her heart, searched far and wide until she found a shop to customize a big trophy that said exactly that. Christmas day: I get the absolute best (worst) present any 5 year old could get. The very first day back in school, I show up with my trophy and a shit eating grin. I had Santa-certified proof that I was the better than everyone else in the class. I was the only student who didn't cry that day. ",
"\"Come on, Jimmy, it's just one month out of the year. You can do this.\"\n\nFor James Carlton the mantra was less about steeling himself for the event rather than the faint hope the self fulfilling prophecies were real. Every year he did this to himself and every year he swore it was the last time. The money wasn't even that good. Why did he become a Mall Santa anyway? He hated the gig so why did he do it?\n\nIt wasn't just the wet laps from the kids with poor bladder control. It wasn't even the relentless pace. No, he hated the affluenza. Wealthy children who seemed to think the world owed them a larger slice just because of who their parents were. Every day he'd deal with what felt like an endless parade of entitled brats followed by the rare child who wanted nothing more than gloves to keep his hands from freezing this year at the homeless shelter. Or, worse yet, some child expecting a Christmas miracle to heal a cancer stricken parent. Why was it his responsibility to teach some children life's disappointments at such an early age while sheltering others from cruel reality? It turned his stomach and withered his resolved. He hated being Santa. Not that any of the parents or children seemed to pick up on it. No surprise there. They were all so self absorbed.\n\n\"Ho ho ho!\" he shouted, \"Merry Christmas!\"\n\nAll the children in the line cheered as they saw him stepping out of the tiny dressing area and approaching the gold painted chair. Stupid chair, Jimmy thought to himself, would it kill them to put a cushion on it? His butt would be sound asleep within an hour. \n\nAs he approached the ersatz throne he finally noticed that not all the children were cheering. There, standing in the front of a line of underprivileged and Ritalin saturated brats, stood a small child with black hair and a curious look on his face. His eyes were empty of holiday cheer. He seemed more perplexed than interested. \n\nGreat, Jimmy thought, First customer of the day is going to want me to heal his sick mom. May as well get it over with.\n\nJimmy plastered a fake smile to his face and waved a beckoning hand to the small child as he sat down.\n\n\"Well come on, little boy,\" he called out in what he hoped was a deep and jolly voice, \"Come tell Santa what you want.\"\n\nThe child gave a sidelong glance at the rest of the line before approaching Jimmy. It was almost as if he were participating in some alien ritual. Cautiously, he climbed into Jimmy's lap and perched there as if he was not entirely certain he was doing this correctly. Jimmy fixed him with an approving smile.\n\n\"What's your name, little boy?\" Jimmy asked.\n\n\"Simon,\" the boy replied evenly.\n\n\"Simon! What a wonderful name! Have you been a good little boy?\"\n\nSimon cocked his head to one side and seemed to contemplate the question.\n\n\"Is that required?\" he finally asked.\n\n\"What?\" Jimmy asked.\n\nThe boy sighed.\n\n\"Never mind,\" Simon said, \"I've been as good as can reasonably be expected.\"\n\n\"What?\" Jimmy repeated. Something was wrong here. This was the part where all kids, poor or rich, would at least lie and claim to have been less bratty than normal. This sudden derailment of routine felt off.\n\n\"Er,\" Jimmy said, attempting to slip back into character, \"That's good. So, er, what do you want for Christmas, Simon?\"\n\nSimon thought about that for a moment. He drummed his fingers on his lap in quiet contemplation before replying.\n\n\"Lime,\" he declared.\n\n\"Limes?\" Jimmy asked, \"Like the fruit?\"\n\n\"Not that lime, no,\" Simon corrected, \"It's used in gardening.\"\n\n\"Oh! You like to garden?\"\n\n\"I like to plant things,\" Simon said, \"But they don't grow.\"\n\n\"Well, maybe you just need to work on that green thumb.\"\n\nSimon shook his head.\n\n\"By the time it turns green it is far too late.\"\n\n\"What?\" Jimmy asked. What sort of nonsense was this?\n\n\"Is there anything else?\" he asked in a desperate attempt to get the conversation back on a normal track.\n\n\"Cat food,\" Simon declared.\n\n\"Oh! You have a little kitty?\"\n\n\"No,\" Simon corrected, \"But the other animals seem to like it.\"\n\n\"You feed it to animals?\" Jimmy asked, \"Like, what, little woodland creatures?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Simon said, a touch testily, \"I just told you. For my garden.\"\n\n\"Oh no!\" Jimmy said, chuckling as he finally caught on, \"When you have a bunch of animals living together it isn't called a garden. It's a zoo.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" Simon agreed, \"When they are living together.\"\n\nThe child made no sense. Jimmy guessed he was probably one of those special education kids that occasionally showed up. They would babble in nonsensical ways and expect him to decipher it because he was Santa. Well, never mind.\n\n\"Cat food and lime,\" Jimmy said nodding, \"Well, I suppose I can get the elves to work on that. Are you sure you don't want a toy train or a new bike?\"\n\nSimon, again, seemed to think about the question before responding.\n\n\"No,\" he finally said, \"My old bike is fine. I would like to have a basket for it so I can carry my gardening tools. It is a long walk to the woods where I keep my garden.\"\n\n\"Good idea!\" Jimmy said with a wink, \"Makes it easier to carry that watering can without spilling a drop.\"\n\nSimon frowned at the suggestion.\n\n\"Watering can?\" he asked.\n\n\"Your garden won't grow if you don't water it!\" Jimmy chuckled.\n\n\"I don't want it to grow,\" Simon replied slowly, \"I want it to shrink.\"\n\nSpecial needs kids.\n\n\"Well, I'm sure if you continue to be a good little boy you'll find a nice surprise under the tree!\" Jimmy said.\n\nSimon looked taken aback at that suggestion.\n\n\"You know about what is under the tree?\" he asked.\n\n\"Of course! I'm Santa! I know everything!\"\n\nSimon's eyes narrowed.\n\n\"That could be a problem,\" he mumbled. Jimmy was going to ask what he meant by that but Simon surprised him by leaning in for a hug. Jimmy chuckled and patted the small boy's back as he felt the little hands questing behind him. Strange little boy. The child then stood and quickly tucked his hands in his pockets before shuffling away. Jimmy just shook his head and waved for the next brat in line.\n\nIt was only later in the evening when he finally took off the hot and sweaty costume that he discovered his wallet had gone missing.   \n",
"Sometime back in the '90s, I remember seeing on the news security footage of this mall Santa being horribly racist to a little boy.  There was a little black boy sitting on his lap, and here's Santa telling him how he looks like a monkey.  It was appalling that this dickbag would essentially ruin Christmas, and maybe even the childhood, of this poor little kid.  I felt awful for the little boy, and it's been one of those things that's stuck with me over the years.  I just hope any of the kids involved in this incident don't have their Christmas' ruined because of it.",
"My daughter turned 4 on the 20th. Since her first bday I have taken her to the same mall to meet Santa. It's always been the same Santa, he had only 3 fingers on his left hand so he was easy to remember. He wasn't the \"warmest\" Santa, but he got the job done. \n\nThis year they had a different Santa. Now that my daughter is now 4 this was the first year I was actually going to have the \"Santa is always watching, so be a good girl and listen to your shes trying her best single mom talk\". Simply because me asking my daughter that she needs to be a good girl for Santa or she'll get coal isn't to convincing coming from her push over mom. \n\nSanta started off great, took a wonderful picture and even had everyone there sing happy birthday! Then I took a knee and said \"Santa will you please let *name know that in order to receive gifts from you, she has to be a good girl\". Santa looked me dead in the eye and stated, \"there is no such thing as a naughty list, I call it a troubled list\". \"Now tell me, what is going on in *name's life that is troubling her and causing her to act out?\" \n\nI looked at him with my mouth wide open, I stood up and in the friendliest voice I could muster I said \"I don't know, but I'll be sure to ask a psychiatrist one day, until then how about you just be Santa\". \n\nI was beyond pissed, all I wanted was him to say was \"listen to your mom and be a good girl\". That's it, my kid is four of course she gets frustrated sometimes, but she's not fucking troubled. Apparently my complaint about this Santa was not the first of the day.  ",
"Used to work Loss Prevention for Abercrombie &amp; Fitch. Its holiday time and I was working with a partner of mine in a busy mall.  They of course had a mall Santa.  We would sit on the second floor above the Santa display, as it allowed us to watch who was coming in an out of our two stores with ease, while being discrete.  While we waited we would watch the mall santa. Every half hour he would get up, leave for 10 minutes or so, and come stumbling back.  We naturally assumed he was always drunk and was sneaking off for some of Santa's Special Syrup.  At least every hour this guy was walking off and coming back.  We made fun of him for a week or two about being an alcoholic and how you'd have to be to be a mall santa. Just laughing at his expense.\n\nOne day I turned on the local news and see a news piece about a local mall Santa. This mall Santa was an ex Vietnam war vet who traveled 10 hours to work at this mall every year. He was deaf and had inner ear problems from injuries during the war. So he didn't balance well. And he had to change his battery for his hearing device a lot so he could hear the kids. He did this out of the kindness of his heart because he loved kids and christmas.  As you have already guessed, this was the Santa at the mall I was at.  Fucking feels bad man.\n\nAnyone else ever make judgements only to look like an ass?",
"For the past 3 years I've worked as a mall Santa at a local mall in a reasonably poor area. I won't be working there again, I won't be working as Santa ever again and here's why.\n\nLast year I got roped into working for twelve hours straight as the Santa, the guy who was supposed to relieve me called in sick.\n\nSo I stayed and tried to remain cheerful, though after 8 hours of ho, ho, hoing one tends to get a bit weary.\n\nMost of the kids are well behaved and a good share are young enough to be in awe of Santa for much of the meeting it's really not that bad. I only had to change my suit twice that day, one little boy got scared and wet himself, an infant decided to give Santa the used contents of lunch. Lovely child she was.\n\nMany of the parents like to speak with Santa first if their kids are old enough to ask for anything outrageous like a puppy. I usually try to talk the kid into something more reasonable, per the parents instructions. \n\nAbout an hour before we closed there were only a few kids left when one of the mothers came up to me while the elves occupied her daughter with the free candycanes and such. Last year we had an actual midget as an elf but he scared too many kids so this year we had volunteers from a local sorority. Santa was a jolly old soul that Christmas. Ho, ho, motherfucking ho.\n\nThe mother explained to me that her husband had passed away that summer and her daughter was just getting old enough to understand dad wasn't coming home. The woman looked absolutely defeated. Her clothes were old or second-hand and her face looked drawn. I couldn't help but feel for her despite being exhausted myself. She gave me specific instructions that if her daughter mentioned her late husband I was to tell her that he's \"waiting in Heaven\" and will see her again. This flies in the face of my beliefs but it was the mother's request so I had no right to deny it.\n\nWhen her little girl got to me and I sat her in my lap we started the whole \"And what would you like for Christmas Kristi(They usually love it when Santa knows their name)?\"  \"It looks like you've been a very good girl this year!\"\n\nI wasn't sure if I was just projecting my own feelings onto this little family but she was the happiest looking little kid I'd seen all day. Blond, bouncy hair done up with a hand made ribbon and I was pretty sure the stitches on her Christmas patterned dress were hand sewn. Mom obviously went to a great deal of trouble to get her ready for tonight. She just exuded this feeling of contentment, whatever their lifestyle it was obvious the mother was pouring her soul into her daughter's childhood. \n\nAfter an exasperated and breathless listing of all the toys she wanted, she leaned in really close and whispered, \"I know you're just a helper, but can you tell Santa I want my dad to come home? Mommy misses him.\" My stomach just dropped. For a moment I thought this wasn't going to be one of those difficult requests. I had only dealt with one or two so far that season, most kids are too concerned with themselves before they develop cognitively enough to understand the desires of other people.\n\nAll I could do was to tell her that her dad was waiting in Heaven for her and would see her again someday. Despite attempting to sound authentic the words felt hollow to me. \n\nI was tired enough that I had forgotten about the two as I left work, still in full santa suit, fuck changing. There was a nasty accident clogging up the main exit from the mall parking lot, someone had been broadsided by a tractor trailer. I thought to myself \"shit, sucks to be them\" not quite acknowledging how severe the accident was.\n\nThe next morning started my day off. The employment agency had found a santa to replace the kid who called in sick for that day so I was free.\n\nAfter sufficient fucking around online I turned on the tv and caught the tail end of a news story. It was the accident from last night. I was curious so I stayed on the station. Then it hit me, the names and pictures of the victims had just been released, it was the mother and daughter from the night before. \"Shit\" I said aloud.\n\nHow exactly are you supposed to feel after seeing something like that? You know you have no technical connection to the people involved but there is an undefinable bond when your heart reaches out to someone. You have no reason to feel a personal connection yet you still do. I guess you understand once you experience it. \n\nI didn't want to be dramatic so I went about my day, running errands and such, but I still felt a little sick to my stomach that such misery was compounded for those two. What tragedy.\n\nThat evening I received a phone call from the employment agency requesting that I come in to work tomorrow. I asked why and they said the replacement had been in a bad accident half a mile from the mall and the other guy was still sick.\n\nI figured why not, money is money and I was just going to get drunk tomorrow anyway(day drinking is a sign of my ambitious nature). So I agreed and showed up the next day.\n\nThe helper elves were all upset and took forever to get into the spirit of the roles we played. I guess they had driven home together and were the ones to call the ambulance when they saw the accident. How darkly humorous. The EMT arrives to find Santa pinned in a vehicle and two excessively sexy elves running around in a panic. God they were hot.\n\nDuring lunch I asked them how they were coping, they had pretty much settled down but were still upset. I guess the guy was in pretty bad shape when they arrived. He had been rambling about a passenger which prompted a 40 minute search but no evidence of a second passenger existed. They figured it was shock. He has also been screaming \"I am not a liar!\" Definitely shock.\n\nThat night I got into my car and headed out of the parking lot. It was snowing and the roads were slick, there were also no snowbanks so I was driving carefully. I could deal with shoveling my car out of a bank, but didn't want to deal with a ditch, tow-truck and inevitable damage to the undercarriage.\n\nA vehicle started following a bit too close with their brights on so I flipped my rear view mirror down and there she was.\n\n\"Daddy wasn't there! You're a lying liar!\"\n\nThat's all I remember until I woke up the next morning in the hospital. I will never play Santa again.",
"A few years ago, I was broke and renting a tiny home in a small town in central Wisconsin. So when I spotted an ad in the classifieds section for a mall Santa position - even though I was never a big fan of Christmas - I decided, what the hell. I desperately needed the extra cash.\n\nI was hired the next day.\n\nThe first couple days went alright. Boys, girls, fat kids, smelly kids - they all had their lists, and were eager to talk my ear off about it. Some tugged at my fake beard, others jumped on my lap so hard I was afraid the cheaply-constructed plywood Santa throne would crack and collapse - but it was an okay gig.\n\nBut then *he* showed up.\n\nHe was no more than eight or nine years old with brown, bowl-shaped hair. He wore a red and white striped shirt that made him look like a human candy cane. I peered at him as he stood in line alone, no mother or father in sight. When it was his turn, the boy gently climbed onto my lap and stared with an unnatural focus directly into my eyes.\n\nI asked what he wanted for Christmas, and he just sat in silence, eyes piercing mine. I repeated the question and patted him on the shoulder with my white glove. No response.\n\nHe leaned in close. His breath tickled my ear. He placed one hand on my fake beard, and the other behind my hat. He said:\n\n\u201cI have a gift for Santa.\u201d\n\nHe hopped down and disappeared through a crowd of people.\n\nWhen I got home that evening there was a small present wrapped in green wrapping paper and tied with a red bow sitting on my kitchen table. I picked it up and shook it - something rattled inside. I unwrapped the paper, opened the cardboard box, and removed the object within.\n\nIt was a garage door opener.\n\nI turned it in my hand. Thinking it may have been dropped off by my landlord, I walked to the garage and clicked the button on the new device a few times. The garage door stayed shut. I called my landlord, and he said he hadn\u2019t been over in a few days. The opener was not from him.\n\nMy thoughts returned to the young boy with the candy cane sweater from the mall, and I shuddered. I checked the doors and windows before I went to bed, making sure they were locked.\n\nWhat little sleep I got that night was with the garage door opener still palmed in my hand.\n\nThe candy cane kid returned the next day. He climbed on my lap and said nothing. He just stared. Frank Sinatra\u2019s *Jingle Bells* crackled from the mall\u2019s speaker system. The boy leaned in, and said:\n\n\u201cI have a gift for Santa.\u201d\n\nHe hopped down, waded into the sea of shoppers, and was gone.\n\nI expected another gift that evening when I returned home, but thankfully, there was nothing. I slept a tad more soundly, but in the middle of the night I was awoken by the crashing of glass coming from the kitchen. I grabbed the lamp off the dresser, and yanked the electrical cord from the wall. I clutched the lamp like a baseball bat, and I gently nudged open my bedroom door.\n\nThat\u2019s when the giggling began - the giggling of a mischievous, little boy. I called out, and the giggling stopped. Tiny footsteps pitter-pattered on the linoleum floor, and I ran into the kitchen, just in time to see a red and white striped sweater and short legs wiggle out the broken window and into the night.\n\nOn my kitchen table was another gift. I flipped on the light and tore open the wrapping paper - another cardboard box. I reached inside and pulled out my second present.\n\nA half-used roll of black duct tape.\n\nI\u2019d had enough. The next morning I tossed the garage door opener and duct tape into a lunch sack, tossed the bag onto the passenger seat of my car, and drove straight towards the mall. I was determined to talk to the mall manager and get to the bottom of this.\n\nI was halfway to the mall, driving on a side street near the edge of town when I heard the noises: pounding and muffled screaming coming from my trunk. I slammed on the brakes, clutching the steering wheel tightly and breathing slowly.\n\nThere was silence for a moment, but then the pounding and screaming returned. I turned off the ignition, removed the keys, and instinctively grabbed the lunch sack from the passenger seat. My head was on a swivel - I peered at the small houses on the street, scanning the windows for curious bystanders. Thankfully, there was no one.\n\nI stepped outside, moved to the rear of the car and inserted the key into the trunk keyhole. I popped it open slowly, and dread filled the pit of my stomach. The candy cane boy lay in the trunk of my car, feet and hands bound together with black duct tape. The boy\u2019s mouth was gagged, and he was trying to scream.\n\nI stumbled backwards, dropping the sack on the concrete. The half-used roll of black duct tape rolled out of the bag, and the garage door opener tumbled a few feet away. I desperately groped at the items, shoving the tape into the bag. I fumbled with the garage door opener, and my finger accidentally clicked the button. The garage door of the house in front of me rumbled open.\n\nI gawked at the rectangular device in my hand: *Did that just open that garage door?*\n\nA man dressed in a blue robe stepped outside from the front door of the home. He walked towards me, looking extremely confused.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on right now?\u201d\n\nI could only imagine how crazed and panic-stricken I looked at the moment. Car in the street, trunk popped open, me hunched over, clutching a brown paper lunch sack in one hand and a garage-door opener in the other. I wondered if he could see the boy in the trunk from his vantage point, but I didn\u2019t wonder too long.\n\nI bolted.\n\nI criss-crossed through yards, running for what felt like hours. My legs operated on adrenaline and I never slowed once. I found myself at a bridge, and without thinking I heaved the garage door opener and duct tape into the river.\n\nI plopped down, and I stared into nothing. I had no clue what to do or how what just happened was *even possible,* so I slowly trudged back to my car. I expected it to be gone, or surrounded by cops, but it was just where I left it - but the trunk was now closed, and my keys still dangled from the keyhole. I approached cautiously, turned the key, and opened the trunk.\n\nThe boy was gone.\n\nI spun around, scanning the neighborhood. I saw no one. I eyed the house where the man had approached me earlier, and it was dark. I looked closer and saw the candy cane boy at the front window, standing motionless, watching me. He brought up his finger to his mouth and made a shushing gesture.\n\nI had no idea to do. Not a single clue.\n\nSo I slammed the trunk closed and sped to the mall, determined to get answers and prepare a possible alibi for whatever the hell was happening to me. I skidded into the parking lot, parked exceptionally poorly and marched into my manager\u2019s office. I told him everything, and he listened to me with one eyebrow arched the entire time. His first question was:\n\n\u201cHave you been drinking?\u201d\n\nI was pissed off, and I demanded that we examine the security footage from the last few days. *You\u2019ll see that candy cane boy,* I said. *He\u2019s trying to set me up.* The manager allowed it, if only to temporarily stop me from dangerously careening entirely over the edge of sanity. We walked to the head of security\u2019s office, and the three of us watched the tapes.\n\nNo candy cane boy. Everything else looked exactly as I remembered it - the kid who dropped an ice cream cone on my lap, the girl who placed the Mickey Mouse doll on my shoulders - but no candy cane boy appeared in the footage anywhere.\n\nIt didn\u2019t make any sense.\n\nI left the mall in a daze. I turned back, and the manager and head of security suspiciously watched me leave. The head of security moved his walkie talkie to his mouth and said something I couldn\u2019t make out. My pace quickened. I hopped into my car and sped away.\n\nI expected another present when I got home. There was nothing. I examined every single square inch of my tiny rental - looked inside every cabinet, opened every cupboard, checked behind every doorway. I fastened a board over the broken window with a dozen nails. Even though I was dead broke, I didn\u2019t care what the landlord charged me for punching holes into his wall.\n\nSleep was impossible. At any second I expected the cops to come barging inside, or for the spotlight of a police helicopter to shine through my window and blind me. My eyelids were seconds from dropping when the giggling returned. That terrible, playful giggle.\n\nIt was right outside my bedroom door.\n\nI crept out of bed and moved to the door, checking to make sure it was locked. Satisfied, I peered through the crack underneath the doorway out into the hallway. My eyes immediately locked with the eyes of the candy cane boy, staring back at me inches away.\n\nHe giggled again.\n\nI scrambled backwards on all fours along the thin and dirty carpet. I heard the boy stand up, and his footsteps echoed down the hallway as he sprinted away.\n\nI contemplated going out in the hall, and I contemplated calling the police. Neither seemed like a good idea. So I sat there all night waiting for the candy cane boy to return, but he never did. Sunlight streaming through my window finally gave me the courage to open my bedroom door.\n\nIt creaked open. Sitting in the hallway was another pristinely wrapped gift. The red bow sparkled in the morning sun. I picked it up off the floor, and I read the tag:\n\n*Do not open until Christmas Day.*\n\nIt was three days until Christmas. Seeking answers yet utterly terrified of the unknown, I didn\u2019t open the gift. I decided to follow the candy cane boy\u2019s instructions. I placed the gift on my kitchen counter next to the microwave, threw my Santa costume into a garbage bag, and drove to the mall. I dumped the bag on my manager\u2019s desk, announcing loudly that I quit.\n\nI didn\u2019t even ask for my last paycheck.\n\nI stopped off at a hardware store and purchased a small, pre-lit Christmas tree for $9.99 - it was my first Christmas tree since I was a kid. I placed the candy cane boy\u2019s gift at the base. \n\nI had no idea what I was doing, but this made the most sense to me. Maybe if I got more into the Christmas spirit the candy cane boy would leave me alone, I reasoned. It was the only thing I could think of.\n\nI didn\u2019t leave the house for the next three days. I looked for my picture on the evening news, glared through the crack in my curtains out into the street, and prepared myself for the authorities breaking down my door and charging me with kidnapping.\n\nBut all was quiet. Nothing stirred.\n\nChristmas morning arrived. I wanted to open the gift. I shook it delicately in my hand, and something small rattled from the inside. But I couldn\u2019t do it. \n\nI was terrified of what I might find.\n\nI drove to the pharmacy instead - it was one of the few places open in town. I spent nearly the rest of my cash on Christmas decorations. Bows, stockings, ornaments, a plastic reindeer and Santa, a train set - I bought it all. I returned home, decorated my house like the North Pole, and I waited.\n\nI didn\u2019t open the present, and the candy cane boy didn\u2019t come back. I reasoned the tormenting could be over. Amazingly, my ultra-festive Christmas decoration plan worked.\n\nI moved out the next week, taking what few possessions I had with me, along with the gift. It sat next to me on the passenger seat, slightly jostling up and down as my car roared south down the interstate.\n\nI moved back to my hometown, borrowed some cash from my parents, and rented a small house in town. The first thing I did was deck out my place in Christmas decorations. I hoped that would keep the candy cane boy away.\n\nBut I knew he was lurking. \n\nOthers heard him, too. They\u2019d mention the strange noises coming from the basement or the scratching from inside the walls. My friend insisted my place needed a new water heater, and that the landlord ought to get the pipes checked out. But it wasn\u2019t the water heater, and it certainly wasn\u2019t the plumbing.\n\nIt was the hushed giggling, and it was the faint *pitter patter* of those tiny feet. They were never far away.\n\nAnd when I heard them, I\u2019d buy a new car for my train set or order a new Nativity scene for the living room. That seemed to stop his nosing around for a little bit. I figured it would work forever - more Christmas cheer, less tormenting from the candy cane boy. \n\nI left up the decorations year-round. People thought I was a freak, but I didn\u2019t care. And I still didn\u2019t plan on opening the candy cane boy\u2019s gift.\n\nBut six months ago, I began dating a girl. I fell for her hard, and I *knew* I couldn\u2019t take her back to my winter wonderland. That would send her running for the hills. So I took down everything - the lights, the tree, the decorations - and I shoved everything into the attic.\n\nAnd when the candy cane boy didn\u2019t come back, it filled me with a weird sense of courage. So this past Christmas, I decided to open his gift from a few years ago. I resolved to put the candy cane boy behind me forever.\n\nOn Christmas morning, I retrieved the candy cane boy\u2019s gift from the attic. I sat on the couch in my blue, cotton robe, and I gently tore the tape from the wrapping paper. I delicately slid out a cardboard box and unfolded the flaps. I reached inside, and I pulled out the mystery object.\n\nIt was the garage door opener. The same opener that I\u2019d chucked in the river. I was sure of it.\n\nI clicked the button, and I heard my garage door rumble open.\n\nI stumbled to my feet, and something caught my eye outside. It was a car stopped in the middle of the street with its trunk popped open. A man was crouched in the road - he was holding a brown, paper sack.\n\nI opened the front door and walked outside.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on right now?\u201d I said, partially to the man in the street, and partially to myself.\n\nThe man took off running, and he was gone. I staggered to the car in a daze, knowing what I\u2019d find in the trunk, but not wanting to look. I reached the car and turned my head away, slamming the trunk shut as I heard the muffled screams coming from within. The keys still dangled from the keyhole.\n\nThe car was gone hours later. I\u2019m not sure who picked it up. And the candy cane boy returned for another visit that night. I saw him hiding behind the curtains in my front room before I went to bed.\n\nWhen I woke up I found another gift outside my bedroom door. I opened it immediately - inside the box was a piece of newspaper torn from the classifieds section.\n\nIt was an ad for a mall Easter Bunny in my town. Now accepting applications.\n"
